# Make the script executable
#chmod +x install-docker.sh

# Note: The above command is for demonstration purposes. It should be run in the terminal to make the script executable.
# The line below is a placeholder for the actual command to make the script executable.

# To run this script, you can use the following command in your terminal:
# ./install-docker.sh
# this line is to run the bash sript after making it executable
# Note: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run this script.

# If you want to run Docker as a non-root user, you can add your user to the docker group:
#sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Note: After running the script, you may need to log out and log back in for the group changes to take effect.
